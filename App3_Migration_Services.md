APPENDIX 3

## PROFESSIONAL SERVICES

<!-- image -->

This Appendix 3 to the Red Hat Enterprise Agreement describes certain professional services to be performed by Red Hat on behalf of Client and certain terms associated with these services.

## 1.1 Red Hat Professional Services

Red Hat will assign a consultant or consultants (" Consultant " or " Consultants ", respectively) who will assist Client in its use of Red Hat's technology and services (" Professional Services "). The Professional Services will be provided on a time and materials basis and will be limited to the number of hours of Professional Services set forth in the Purchase Summary subject to the Consumption Rules below. The overall responsibility regarding the successful use of Red Hat's technology and services by Client rests with the Client.

## Outline

Red Hat has been approached by Client to assist in the migration of its legacy Red Hat Enterprise Linux fleet to new, endorsed Standard Operating Environments, and covered by vendor support and adequate remaining lifespan.

A staged approach is proposed, whereby in the first stage, Red Hat will assist the Client in the preparation of offerings that will be extended to the application teams who own the systems being upgraded. This includes the ratification of the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 and 9 SOE Provisioning and In-Place-Upgrade Processes with all stakeholders.

In a second stage, the Red Hat team will assist the Client Project Team who is responsible deciding on the upgrade method with a group of up to five (5) pilot app teams by providing a clear outline of the offerings, the upgrade menu (in-place vs side-by-side) and expertise to address application team queries in a rapid turn around manner.

In a third stage, the Red Hat team will assist in performing the upgrade work in conjunction with a Client resource.

Red Hat will provide Professional Services to assist with the following tasks:

## Detailed Scope

## Stage 1 - Preparation

- ● Perform Metrics Based Process Mapping on the existing SOE Provisioning process(es), including estimation of lead and process time the process takes to execute.
- ● Provide indication of the execution times that an automation-enabled new version of the process would achieve given two 2-week sprints of automation development.
- ● Perform Metrics Based Process Mapping on the RHEL 7->8 and 8->9 validation and upgrade process, including advance suitability assessment.
- ● Prepare a menu of endorsed upgrade options that will be offered (to be agreed, may contain RHEL 7->8 in-place upgrade & side-by-side, 8->9 in-place upgrade and side-by-side, temporary exemption, permanent exemption)
- ● Engage Project Team to ensure they are informed and equipped with endorsed offerings extended to application teams, and are capable of addressing customer queries (rollback, adding configuration or components to new SOEs, ownership, implications of in-place-upgrade vs side-by-side-build, etc.) to ensure their interaction with application teams is kept as short as possible and yields workable verdicts.
- ● Ensure required tooling is set up to the desired design (Red Hat Satellite, Ansible Automation Platform) to provide services towards the provisioning and in-place-upgrade processes.

The Project Team will be engaged as early as possible within this phase to validate the approach. Upon completion of this phase.

Upon completion, the team will showcase the capability to perform in-place upgrades and new builds of the offered systems, using the process made possible by present tooling (Red Hat Satellite).

Future scope (not covered in this scope) may be assigned to expanding the use of automation tooling towards revised versions of these processes.

Stage 2 - Assist Project Team in Readying Pilot Group of App Teams and Systems

- ● Assist in technical discussion conducted by project and app team to facilitate clear decisions
- ● For in-place upgrades, execute the pre-upgrade check offered by the upgrade tooling to clear the nominated systems for in-place upgrade
- ● Iterate on the SOE offerings as required with any feedback about gaps from the application teams.
- ● Provide an application team engagement method document that describes the method used to engage the application teams and the estimated effort cost of each team engaged.

Upon completion, the team will present an agreed upgrade list, an agreed schedule for the nominated systems, the upgrade method to be used, and where in-place-upgrades are to be used, an advance upgrade suitability test run on the systems indicating a successful upgrade is expected. The team will also present a clear back-out plan in the event the upgrade does not go to plan.

Stage 3 - Perform the upgrade tasks on the nominated systems prepared in Stage 2

- ● Assist in the performance of in-place upgrades on the systems that require such
- ● Assist in the performance of any side-by-side builds required of the systems required
- ● Assist testing and rollback operations as required
- ● Provide as-built documentation

Upon completion, the team will present documentation covering as-built detail, as well as overall time taken to complete the upgrades, to inform larger scale rollout in future scope.

## Stage 4 - Batch Upgrades

- ● Assist with RHEL upgrades at scale for the remaining applications
- ● Continuously Improve on upgrade timeframes
- ● Work with customer team members to further enable their capabilities to finalise any remaining upgrades
